\subsubsection{Overview}

The proper PCB layout of the driver board is just as essential as that of the power board. To keep the price of the PCB's down, both the power and the driver board has to be kept under $100mm \times 100mm$. The layer number of the boards is also a pricey concern. Read more on PCB selection in Section \ref{PCB_selection}. The driver board was designed on 2-layer FR4 1 oz. material. \\

The power board was first laid out to get a precise and optimal placement of the critical components, power rails, outputs and interboard connectors. After that came defining the contour of the driver board, precise placement of interboard connectors and crude placement of components. It is vital for all signals to have their firm ground plane under them to act as reference. That is why the bottom side of the driver board was partitioned according to the components on the top side to have their respective ground planes. The surface of the copper fills were reduced as much as possible to counter capacitive noise propagation. Supply-ground decoupling capacitors were placed as close to their supported components as possible. 0805 and 1206 size code footprints were placed to have more possibilities for modification or rework if need be. A cut-out over the power rails provides space for the electrolyte capacitors attached to the bus bar. For approximate mechanical construction, see Figure \ref{fig:mech_persp} and Figure \ref{fig:mech_top}.

\subsubsection{Power board}

Individual PCB's of $100mm \times 65mm$ were chosen for each phase which makes it possible to keep the board within the general size constraints and fit the available $100mm \times 200mm$ heat sink. The three boards are interconnected with the power rail busbars. Screw holes in each provide fixture points to help with assembly. Only the top side of the aluminum PCB has a copper layer which is divided into 3 regions. The first is the battery positive side, it is connected to the drain of the high-side transistors. The common region is the output, it gives place to the high-current screw terminal. The source of the low-side transistors is connected to the battery negative. To provide the best supply-ground capacitive decoupling and keep the circuit highlighted in Figure \ref{fig:cap_circ} as short as possible, capacitors are placed along the border of the VCC and GND planes. Electrolyte capacitors are attached to the busbars. It is important to have as high capacitance as possible while keeping the ESR (Equivalent Series Resistance) and stray inductance to a minimum. \textit{UVZ2A471}\cite{elco} was therefore chosen. Its small form factor provides all the aforementioned advantages. The MOSFETs are as close to each other as possible. The space is limited by the presence of the interboard connector conducting the gate current. Having the shortest possible traces for source and gate helps with reducing the stray capacitance and inductance of the line. It is important in order to have uniform turn-on and turn-off times. Screw holes are also present to help press the power board against the heat sink for better thermal coupling.
