\section{Control}

The control will be done with vector control where the motor currents are transformed from a 3-phase AC signal to a single vector in a rotating dp-frame with a Clarke and a Park transformation. The controller is placed in the dq-frame and its output signals are then converted out from a rotating vector in the dq-frame back to a 3-phase signal.
