\section{Discussion}
To further explorer the project, having 4 months to create inveter, driver, control, embedded control and a physical product is a big task. This was also been stated before the project started, and while having done what was possible, with more time a physical inveter with all the controls could have been build. \\

As of now the aspects, of what goes into a motor driver has been laid out. If more resources and time was the disposal, the theory to real world view could have been made clear. The reasoning for this statement has ground in previous semester groups. While discussing this current project, it's clear that theory and the physical world doesn't all ways match. This could have been a huge learning opportunity, hypothetically if a real motor driver was created tested and analyzed why it worked or didn't work, gives good knowledge of what needs to be in focus, if such a project comes around again. \\
