\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


To minimize the size of the power and driver PCB's and improve the modularity the PCB's are made to only handle one phase and three boards will then be used to handle the three-phases.
For power board an aluminum PCB was used to have a high heat conductivity which allows for the use of SMD MOSFET's as the high power transistors. The driver board was build to be mounted directly on top of the power board to minimize driver signal transmission paths and stray inductance's.

The motor is controlled on the Zynq with a PI controller in a field orientated way. Each phase it controlled by a dual PWM module with dead time between the two PWM signals.
The angle out of the encoder has a low resolution so a more accurate angle is approximated at low speeds with the use of a linear interpolation algorithm.
