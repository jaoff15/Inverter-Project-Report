% \begin{itemize}
% \item We need to comment on the inverter
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Inverter
%         \item Driver
%         \item Contruction
%         \item does it live up to the requirements
%     \end{itemize}
% \item Explaination of how the control circuit, is the correct version of the motor model with correct values for the controllers.
% \item comment on the programming
% Explain how the different parts of the "program" can be used in conjunction with the inverter, in order to get the motor running.
