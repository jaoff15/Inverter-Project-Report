% The introduction to the bulk of the report, starts out with a explanation of the project consist of, that leads into the different aspect of the project. Hardware and control explains the physical part need for the driver of the gokart. It goes into details of the electrical components used and why they specifically was chosen. The design of circuits and the implementation. The software explains the low-level drivers and signal routing implemented in the FPGA part of the controller as well as the higher level software implemented on the ARM core of the controller. \\

% Last part of the report, goes into discussion about project as a whole and conclusion explaining, if the goal of the project was reached. \\

% With the end being figure, lists, table of content and references.\\
